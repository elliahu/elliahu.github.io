I’ve always played video games a little differently. While most people are busy saving the world or fighting off enemies, I’m sitting there wondering, how do they make this look so good? Like, how do they turn a bunch of code into moss so realistic it makes you want to touch it? These questions didn’t just cross my mind—they took over my life.

Now, as a software engineer, I’ve made it my mission to understand how computer graphics actually work. Shaders, rendering pipelines, real-time lighting—it’s like a giant puzzle, and I can’t resist taking it apart to see how it fits together. Honestly, building these systems is just as fun (if not more) than watching the final visuals on the screen.

I’ll never forget the time I played Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5. While everyone else was raving about the story and gameplay, I was staring at a patch of moss. One patch of moss. For an hour. I mean, the texture, the lighting, the tiny imperfections—chef’s kiss. That moss made me realize just how much I love the mix of art and engineering behind computer graphics.

It’s not just about games, either. From virtual reality to scientific simulations, I’m fascinated by how graphics shape our digital worlds. Whether I’m geeking out over shaders or brainstorming new ways to render something cool, I’m all in. It’s not just work; it’s what keeps me curious—and occasionally makes me weirdly emotional about moss.
