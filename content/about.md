I’ve always approached video games a little differently than most. While others get caught up in the gameplay, I’ve always been drawn to what’s happening behind the scenes. How do these stunning visuals keep pushing boundaries year after year? How is it possible to render such detailed, lifelike worlds on everyday hardware? These questions didn’t just pique my curiosity—they shaped my career.

As a software engineer, I’ve channeled this fascination into understanding the technology that powers computer graphics. From shaders and rendering pipelines to real-time lighting and optimization, I’m passionate about breaking down how it all works and building systems that bring these concepts to life. For me, the process of creating visuals is as exciting as seeing the finished result on the screen.

I still remember playing Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5 and being completely mesmerized—not by the action-packed gameplay, but by a simple patch of moss. I spent over an hour studying its texture, lighting, and tiny imperfections, captivated by how convincingly real it looked. That moment crystallized what drives me: a deep appreciation for the artistry and engineering behind computer graphics.

My curiosity doesn’t stop at games. Whether it’s architectural visualization, virtual reality, or scientific simulations, I’m inspired by how computer graphics blend creativity and technology to shape the way we see and interact with digital worlds. As both a software engineer and a graphics enthusiast, I’m committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and contributing to the incredible visual experiences that define our era.
